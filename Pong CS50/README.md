OVERVIEW:
This repository contains my Pong game assignment for the CS50's Introduction to Game Development course.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Pong is a classic arcade game that simulates table tennis.
The main objective is to score points by hitting a ball past the opponent's paddle.
This project provides a starting point to implement and enhance the game mechanics, graphics, and overall user experience.
The assignment's goal is to implement a basic AI for either 1 or 2 players in the game.
In addition, I created a mode selection where players can choose to play vs another player or the AI.

USER GUIDE:
Press 1 and 2 to switch between game modes.
User 1 uses up/down keys to move. User 2 uses W/S keys to move.
Whoever scores 10 points first wins.
